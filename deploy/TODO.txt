HIGH PRIORITY (must be done before 1.0)
---------------------------------------
- deployment plan item weighting
- installation / implementation guide. FAQ
- Delete confirmations
- Views
- Blocks and other non ssf settings
- simpletests
- doxygen
- Logging / auditing (new table ?)
- better error handling on services
- figure out what to do with perms

LOWER PRIORITY (can wait if need be)
------------------------------------
- Confirmation of install (?)
- move some code to includes (plan_admin.inc / server_admin.inc)
- better menu organization (so breadcrumb is better)
